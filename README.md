*DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT* :

✅ This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for breast cancer classification using 100% HTML for documentation and presentation.

📊 The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset from Scikit-learn.

📥 Data is loaded into a DataFrame, and basic information such as shape, class distribution, and sample rows is displayed.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) includes visualizations like class distribution and a correlation heatmap to understand data patterns.

🧪 Feature selection is done using ANOVA F-test with SelectKBest, and the top 10 features are selected based on their statistical significance.

📉 A bar plot is used to visualize the feature importance scores using -log10(p-value).

🤖 Three classification models are built: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, each trained using a pipeline with StandardScaler.

📈 All models are evaluated using four key metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

🏆 Logistic Regression and Random Forest models perform best, both achieving high accuracy and balanced precision/recall.

✅ The best model is selected based on the highest accuracy score — Logistic Regression in this case.

🌐 The entire workflow — from imports and data loading to model training and evaluation — is clearly explained and organized in HTML format only, making it easy to understand and present visually.

📚 This project serves as a well-structured educational tool, showcasing machine learning logic through a front-end presentation with no additional frameworks or programming interfaces used in the output files.
